# Chapter 2: Trait Approach

This chapter is all about the trait approach. The idea that leaders are born with certain traits and that is what makes them great leaders. This is also known as the "Great Man" approach to leadership because looking back at history, there were certain great figures that could be declared as leaders.

This theory focused on identifying innate qualities and characteristics possessed by great social, political, and military leaders.

## Major Leadership Traits

After years of research, there were 5 traits that emerged as essential for leadership. These are traits to possess or cultivate if one seeks to be perceived by others as a leader.

- Intelligence
  - verbal, perceptual, and reasoning capabilities
- Self-Confidence
  - certainty about one's skills and competencies
- Determination
  - desire to get the job done. Also called drive or motivation, moxie.
- Integrity
  - the quality of honesty and trustworthiness
- Sociability
  - inclination to seek out pleasant social relationship

## Five-Factor Personality Model and Leadership

Judge et al (2002) determined there was a strong correlation betwen personality traits and leadership.

The five personality traits they studied were:

1. Neuroticism - tendency to be depressed, insecure, anxious, vulnerable
2. Extroversion - tendency to be sociable and assertive and possess positive energy
3. Openness - tendency to be informed, creative, insightful, and curious
4. Agreeableness - tendency to be accepting, conforming, trusting, and nurturing
5. Conscientiousness - tendency to be thorough, organized, controlled, dependable

When conducting their research, they determined that leaders tended to be (in order of importance):

- Extroverted (Most important trait of effective leaders)
- Conscientious (also has the highest correlation to being an effective worker)
- Open
- low levels of neuroticism
- Agreeable (not a useful trait for leaders)

## Strengths and Leadership

The definition of strength it the ability to consistently demonstrate exceptional work. They come from having certain talents and further developing those talents by gaining additional knowledge, skills, and practice. Leadership capability is improved when we are able to identify strengths and weaknesses and work within those.

## Emotional Intelligence and Leadership

Emotional Intelligence is defined as the ability to perceive and apply emotions to life's tasks, understand other's emotions, express emotions, use emotions to facilitate thinking, and manage emotions in oneself and relationships.

People who are more sensitive to their emotions and their impact will be more effective leaders.

Emotional Intelligence can be measured in EQ (emotional quotient). MSCEIT says EQ is the ability to perceive, facilitate, understand, and manage emotion. Goleman has EQ as a set of personal and social competencies such as self-awareness, confidence, self-regulation, conscientiousness, and motivation. Shankman and Allen has EQ as awareness of three aspects of leadership: context, self, others.

## Focus of Trait Approach

The trait approach focuses solely on the leader and the traits that they possess. It never takes into account the followers. Because of this, organizations will routinely use personality tests to find the "right" people based on these traits.

## Strengths

This approach is intuitively appealing. It is easy for us to look at leaders and just assume they were "born with it". It plays to our innate need to view leaders as gifted individuals.

Due to a century of research, there is some credibility to this approach. It also delves very deeply into the leadership side of the leader-follower relationship. Because of it's simplicity, it provides benchmarks for what to look for in a leader.

## Criticisms

Because all leaders are different, it is impossible to nail down a true list of traits. One could come up with an endless list of traits. This approach also never takes into account the situation the leader is in.

Leadership traits can also be highly subjective and difficult to measure. They also fail to measure outcomes to traits. Since traits are thought of as being innate, it something that cannot be trained.

## Application

This approach lays out an effective blue print for the types of traits one so strive for if they want to be in leadership. Also, through various tests and assessments, one can determine what traits they already have that might help them be a good leader as well as point out their weaknesses that they need to improve upon. Managers can use these to determine their position within the organization and figure out how to strengthen their place in it.
