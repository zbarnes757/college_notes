## Leadership Ethics Description

**Ethics**

- Is a derivative of the Greek word ethos, meaning customs, conduct, or character
- Is concerned with the kinds of values and morals an individual or society ascribes as desirable or appropriate
- Focuses on the virtuousness of individuals and their motives
- Example: Journalists’ respect for others, professional duty, concern for harm, proactive social engagement (Plaisance, 2017)

**Ethical Theory**

- Provides a system of rules or principles as a guide in making decisions about what is right/wrong and good/bad in a specific situation
- Provides a basis for understanding what it means to be a morally decent human being

## Practical Ethical Theory

**Kohlberg’s Stages of Moral Development**

1. _Pre-conventional morality_:

   - Stage 1--Obedience and Punishment: Rules are fixed and handed down by authority
   - Stage 2--Individualism and Exchange: An action is right if it serves the individual

2. Conventional morality

   - Stage 3--Interpersonal Accord and Conformity: Conforming to the expectations of others
   - Stage 4--Maintaining the Social Order: Moral decisions show concern for society as a whole

3. Level 3. Post-conventional Morality
   - Stage 5--Social Contract and Individual Rights: Moral decisions based on what a good society should be like
   - Stage 6--Universal Principles: Moral decisions based on internalized universal principles of justice that apply to everyone

## Ethical Theories

- Two Broad Domains: Theories about leaders’ conduct and about leaders’ character

![Figure 13.2](../images/figure_13-2.png)

![Figure 13.3](../images/figure_13-3.png)

Teleological Theories: focus on consequences of actions and results

**Conduct**

- Ethical egoism (create greatest good for the leader)
  - Closely related to transactional leadership theories
  - Example: leader takes a political stand on an issue for no other reason than to get re-elected
- Utilitarianism (create greatest good for greatest number)
  - Example: Leader distributes scarce resources so as to maximize benefit to everyone, while hurting the fewest; preventive health care vs. catastrophic illnesses
- Altruism (show concern for best interests of others)
  - Authentic transformational leadership is based on altruistic principles
  - Example: The work of Mother Teresa, who gave her entire life to help the poor
- Deontological Theories
  - Duty driven, for example, relates not only to consequences but also to whether action itself is good
  - Focus on the actions of the leader and his/her moral obligation and responsibilities to do the right thing
  - Example: telling the truth, keeping promises, being fair
- Virtue-based Theories: About leader’s character
  - Focus on who people are as people
    - Rather than tell people what to do, tell people what to be
    - Help people become more virtuous through training and development
    - Virtues are present within person’s disposition; practice makes good values habitual
    - Examples: Courage, honesty, fairness, justice, integrity, humility
