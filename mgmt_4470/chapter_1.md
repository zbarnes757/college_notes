## Definition of leadership

**Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal**

## Central Components of Leadership

Leadership is a process. It involves the exchange of influence. It only occurs within a group context. Important to note that it involves a common goal
(_This it to make sure that coercive leadership is not considered_).

Leaders and followers are involved together. Leaders and followers need each other in this process. Leaders are often the ones that initiate and maintain the relationship. Leaders are not above or better than their followers.

## Leadership Described

There are several ways in which leadership is described.

- Trait vs Process
- Assigned vs Emergent
- Leadership and Power
- Leadership and Coercion
- Leadership and Management

### Trait vs Process

Trait Leadership is a property or set of properties possessed in varying degrees by different people.

Process Leadership can be observed in leadership behaviors. Because it can be observed in behaviors, it can be learned.

### Assigned vs Emergent

Assigned leadership is based on a position that someone holds (think boss or directors).

Emergent leadership is grown organically when others naturally view the individual as a leader regardless of title. This tends to happen over time due to involvement, being informed, and seeking other's opinions. It has been shown that personality and gender has an affect on this.

### Leadership and Power

Power is the capacity to influence. It is the ability to affect others' beliefs, attitudes, and actions.

Power is derived from 5 sources:

- Referent
- Expert
- Legitimate
- Reward
- Coercive
- Information
