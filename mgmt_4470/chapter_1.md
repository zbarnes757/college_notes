## Definition of leadership

**Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal**

## Central Components of Leadership

Leadership is a process. It involves the exchange of influence. It only occurs within a group context. Important to note that it involves a common goal
(_This it to make sure that coercive leadership is not considered_).

Leaders and followers are involved together. Leaders and followers need each other in this process. Leaders are often the ones that initiate and maintain the relationship. Leaders are not above or better than their followers.

## Leadership Described

There are several ways in which leadership is described.

- Trait vs Process
- Assigned vs Emergent
- Leadership and Power
- Leadership and Coercion
- Leadership and Management

### Trait vs Process

Trait Leadership is a property or set of properties possessed in varying degrees by different people.

Process Leadership can be observed in leadership behaviors. Because it can be observed in behaviors, it can be learned.

### Assigned vs Emergent

Assigned leadership is based on a position that someone holds (think boss or directors).

Emergent leadership is grown organically when others naturally view the individual as a leader regardless of title. This tends to happen over time due to involvement, being informed, and seeking other's opinions. It has been shown that personality and gender has an affect on this.

### Leadership and Power

Power is the capacity to influence. It is the ability to affect others' beliefs, attitudes, and actions.

Power is a relational concern for both leaders and followers.

Power is derived from 5 sources:

- Referent
  - followers identification and liking of the leader
- Expert
  - the followers' perception of the leaders competency
- Legitimate
  - a position or formal job (i.e. king or boss)
- Reward
  - the leader's ability to provide rewards to others (financial or otherwise)
- Coercive
  - the capacity to punish or penalize others.
- Information
  - a leader who has information that others want and need.

Position power is derived from office or rank. Personal power is derived by being knowledgeable or likable.

| Positional Power | Personal Power |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| legitimate       | referent       |
| reward           | expert         |
| coercive         |
| information      |

#### Shift in Leadership Power

Power is no longer in the domain of leaders. With the advent of the internet, knowledge is much easier to access and therefore leaders are no longer the sole source of information. Leaders are not held to a much higher standard and must be more transparent. As a result, leaders are no longer respected as they used to be. This has evolved the relationship between leader and follower to be a more social contract.

### Leadership and Coercion

Coercion involves the use of force to effect change. They tend to manipulate others with rewards and penalties. Typically involves threats, punishments, and negative rewards.

Examples of coercive leaders:

- Adolf Hitler
- Jim Jones
- Taliban leaders

### Leadership and Management

Kotter (1990) took the stance that leadership and management could be broken down into two separate sets of activities. Management activities produce order and consistency. Leadership activities produce change and movement.

Management activities include:

- Planning and budgeting
- Organizing and staffing
- Controlling and problem-solving

Leadership activities include:

- Establishing direction
- Aligning people
- Motivating and inspiring

**While these can be viewed as two separate sets of activities, organizations require both to succeed.**

Managers have unidirectional authority. They are more reactive. They prefer to work with people solving. They tend to have low emotional involvement.

Leaders have multidirectional influence. They are emotionally active and involved. Rather than being reactive, they try to shape ideas. They work to expand available options. They tend to try and change the way people think about what is possible.
