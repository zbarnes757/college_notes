# Chapter 5: Situational Approach

The situational approach focuses on leadership in situations. It emphasizes adapting style to the different situations that leaders find themselves in. It is used extensively in organizational leadership training and development. The situational approach is composed of both a directive dimension and supportive dimension. Each dimension must be applied appropriately in a given situation. Leaders evaluate employees to assess their competence and commitment to perform a given task.

## Leadership Styles

A leadership style is a behavior pattern that a person uses to influence others. It is both directive (task) and supportive (relationship) behaviors.

Directive behaviors help group members in achieving their goals via one way communication. It is manifested through giving directions, establishing goals and how to achieve them, methods of evaluation and time lines, and defining roles.

Supportive behaviors assist group members via two-way communication in feeling comfortable with themselves, coworkers, and the situation. Examples of support behaviors are asking for input, problem solving, praising, and listening.

### S1-Directing Style

In the directing style, the leader focuses communication on goal achievement. They spend less time on supportive behaviors.

### S2-Coaching Style

In this style, the leader focuses on **both** goal achievement and supporting subordinates socioemotional needs. Requires leader involvement through encouragement and soliciting subordinate input.

### S3-Supporting Style

The leader does not focus solely on goals. Rather, they use supportive behaviors to bring out employee skills in accomplishing tasks. The leader will delegate day-to-day decision making but be available to facilitate problem solving.

### S4-Delegating Style

The leader offers less task input and social support. They facilitate subordinates' confidence and motivation in relation to the task. The leader lessens their involvement in goal clarification, planning, and control of details. They will give subordinates control and refrains from intervention and unneeded social support.

## Development Levels

A development level is derived by the degree to which followers have the competence and commitment necessary to accomplish a given task or activity. They go from D1 -> D4, increasing in competency levels as it gets higher.

## Focus

The situational approach assumes that subordinates vacillate along the developmental continuum of competence and commitment. According to this approach, the leader's effectiveness depends on assessing subordinate's developmental position and adapting their leadership style accordingly. The situational approach requires leaders to demonstrate a strong degree of flexibility.

The leader will first diagnose the situation then adapt their style based on it.

## Strengths

It is in high demand in the marketplace because situational leadership is perceived as providing a credible model for training employees to become effective leaders.

It is very practical because it is a straightforward approach that is easily understood and applied in a variety of settings.

Unlike previous approaches, it prescribes how to be a leader. It clearly outlines what you should and should not do in various settings.

It is a highly flexible approach. Situational leadership stresses that effective leaders are those who can change their styles based on task requirements and subordinate needs.

Leaders using this approach will need to change their style to adapt to their subordinates.

## Criticism

There is a lack of an empirical foundation raises theoretical considerations regarding the validity of the approach.

Further research is required to determine how commitment and competence are conceptualized for each developmental level. Model has more predictive power when leader and follower perceptions of competence and commitment match.

Conceptualization of commitment itself and why it varies is very unclear. Replication studies fail to support basic prescriptions of situational leadership model.

It does not account for how particular demographics influence the leader-subordinate prescriptions of the model. For example, experienced employees prefer less directive leadership.

It fails to adequately address the issue of one-to-one versus group leadership in an organizational setting.

The questionnaires used are biased in favor of situational leadership.

## Application

Often used in consulting because itâ€™s easy to conceptualize and apply.

Straightforward nature makes it practical for managers to apply.

Breadth of situational approach facilitates its applicability in virtually all types of organizations and levels of management in organizations.
