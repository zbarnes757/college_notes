## Ohio State Studies

Ohio state developed the Leadership Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ). It is composed of 150 different questions. LBDQ has been applied to a number of different settings including military, industrial, and educational areas. These questionnaire revealed that there were clusters of behaviors that were typical of leaders.

In 1963, they released a shorted version of the LBDQ called the LBDQ-XII. This is the mostly widely used version today. The results show there are two general types of leader behaviors.

The fist is Initiating Structure. It is when leaders provide structure for subordinates. These are task behaviors such as organizing work, giving structure to the work context, defining role responsibility, and scheduling work activities.

The second is Consideration. This is when leaders nurture their subordinates. These are relationship behaviors such as building camaraderie, respect, trust, and liking between leaders and followers.

## University of Michigan Studies

At the same time that Ohio state was conducting its research, the University of Michigan began to study the same behaviors. The came to the conclusion that leaders come in two types as well: Employee orientated and Production oriented. Later, they determined that it is possible to have both orientations at the same time.

## Blake and Mouton’s Grid

This is a proprietary grid that is used to explain how leaders help organizations to reach their purposes. It focuses on Concern for production and Concern for people. The grid has several components that arise.

### Authority-Compliance

This sits in the bottom right at (9,1). It focuses on efficiency in operations results from arranging conditions of work such that human interference is minimal. Heavily focuses on tasks and job requirements. A leader in this sector tend to only communicate when they need to give task instructions. They are highly results driven. Leaders in this area can be seen as controlling, demanding, hard-driving, and overpowering.

### Country Club

This sits in the top left at (1,9). It focuses on thoughtful attention to the needs of people leads to a comfortable, friendly organizational atmosphere and work tempo. Leaders tend to have a low focus on task completion and a higher emphasis on interpersonal relationships. They will deemphasize production in favor of follower's attitudes and feelings. Leaders will try to create a positive atmosphere by being agreeable, eager to help, comforting, noncontroversial.

### Impoverished

This sits in the bottom left at (1,1). Leaders here will focus on minimal effort exerted to get work done is appropriate to sustain organizational membership. They will be unconcerned with tasks and people. They will typically just go through the motions and do the bare minimum. These leaders have little contact with followers and are described as indifferent, noncommittal, resigned, and apathetic.

### Middle-of-the-Road

This sits in the middle at (5,5). Leaders here will focus on adequate organizational performance possible through balancing the necessity of getting work done while maintaining satisfactory morale. These leaders compromise to have equal task and relational focus. In order to achieve equilibrium, the leader will avoid conflict while emphasizing moderate levels of production and interpersonal relationships. These leaders can be described as expedient, preferring the middle ground, and soft-pedals disagreement. They will swallow convictions in the interest of “progress”.

### Team

This sits in the top right at (9,9). Leaders here will have a strong emphasis on both tasks and interpersonal relationships. They will promote a high degree of participation and teamwork, satisfies basic need of employee to be involved and committed to their work These leaders stimulate participation, act determined, make priorities clear, follow through, behave open-mindedly, and enjoy working.

### Paternalism/Maternalism

There a few types of leaders that cause more issues. They tend to fall into this category where their rewards and approval are bestowed on people in return for loyalty and obedience. Any failure to comply leads to punishment. They are sometimes viewed as benevolent dictators. They will regard the organization as a "family" and disassociate the people from the task.

### Opportunism

Opportunistic leaders will adapt and shift to any grid style needed to gain maximum advantage. Their performance occurs according to a system of selfish gain. These types of leaders use any combination of the basic five styles for the purpose of personal advancement. They may be seen as ruthless and cunning or as adaptable and strategic.

## Strengths

The behavioral approach marked a major shift in leadership research from exclusively trait focused to include behaviors and actions of leaders. There have been a broad range of studies to give this approach credibility. As a conceptual level, this is easy because a leader's behaviors fall into 2 basic categories: task and relationship. The behavioral approach is heuristic. Leaders can learn a lot about themselves and how they come across to others by trying to see their behaviors in light of the task and relationship dimensions.

## Criticisms

There is not adequate data to show how a leader's style will relate to performance. No style fits all situations. The style will need to adapt given the situation. It implies that a **High-High** style is best but there is no research to support this. Most of the research is US focused and does not translate well to other cultures.

## Application

Many leadership training programs have been developed based on this approach. It is easy to teach. By addressing their own styles, managers can determine how they are perceived by others and how to change their behaviors to be more effective. This style applies to almost everything a leader does.
