## Descriptions and Perspectives

Team = Group of organizational members who are interdependent, share common goals, and coordinate activities to accomplish those goals

- Can meet face-to-face or be virtual
- Team-based and technology-enabled can use best talent, facilitate collaboration, and reduce travel costs
- But virtual teams are also challenged by separations of time, distance, and culture
- Decisions and scheduling may take more time

Organizational culture needs to support employee involvement

- Heterarchy: fluid power shifting in teams

Team leadership is process oriented

- How do teams develop critical capabilities?
- How do team leaders adjust to contingencies as they arise?
- How do leader actions promote task and interpersonal development?

Shared or Distributed Leadership

- When members of the team take on leadership behaviors to influence the team and maximize team effectiveness
- Shared team leadership improves effectiveness of virtual teams

## Outcomes of Effective Teams

- Greater productivity
- More effective use of resources
- Better decisions and problem-solving
- Better-quality products and services

- Requiring results (clear expectations)

### External Support and Recognition

- Regulated Performance
- Teams supported by external resources are
  - Given the material resources needed to do their jobs
  - Recognized for team accomplishments
  - Rewarded by tying those rewards to team members’ performance, not individual achievement

Principled Leadership influences team effectiveness through four sets of processes (Zaccaro et al., 2001)

1. **Cognitive**--Facilitates team’s understanding of problems confronting them
2. **Motivational**--Helps team become cohesive and capable by setting high performance standards and helping team to achieve them
3. **Affective**--Assists team in handling stressful circumstances by providing clear goals, assignments, and strategies
4. **Integrative**--Helps coordinate team’s activities through matching member roles, clear performance strategies, feedback, and adapting to environmental changes

## Leadership Decision 1

**Should I Monitor the Team or Take Action?**

- Leaders can
  - Diagnose, analyze, or forecast problems (monitoring) or take immediate action to solve a problem
  - Focus on problems within the group (internal) or which problems need intervention
  - Make choices about which solutions are the most appropriate
- Effective leaders have the ability to determine what interventions are needed, if any, to solve team problems
- All members of the team can engage in monitoring
- Leaders differ in timing of taking action

## Leadership Decision 2

**Should I Intervene to Meet Task or Relational Needs?**

Task

- Getting job done
- Making decisions
- Solving problems
- Adapting to change
- Making plans
- Achieving goals

Maintenance Functions

- Developing positive climate
- Solving interpersonal problems
- Satisfying members’ needs
- Developing cohesion

Special challenges of virtual teams

- Leaders should begin with face-to-face meetings to facilitate trust
- Hold regular, organized team meetings
- Not be too task focused
- Work to develop relationships among team members
- Know which technologies are best suited for which task

## Leadership Decision 3

**Should I Intervene Internally or Externally?**

Leader must

- Determine what level of team process needs leadership attention:
- Use internal task or relational team dynamics, if
  - Conflict between group members
  - Team goals unclear
- Use external environmental dynamics, if
  - Organization not providing proper support to team
