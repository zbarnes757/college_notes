## Attitudes

- **Attitudes**: Evaluative statements or judgments concerning objects, people, or events.

Typically, researchers assume that attitudes have three components: cognition, affect, and behavior.

- **Cognitive Component**: The opinion or belief segment of an attitude.
- **Affective Component**: The emotional or feeling segment of an attitude.
- **Behavioral Component**: An intention to behave in a certain way toward someone or something.

Early research on attitudes assumed that they were causally related to behavior— that is, the attitudes people hold determine what they do. However, one researcher, Leon Festinger, argued that attitudes follow behavior. Other researchers have agreed that attitudes predict future behavior.

- **Cognitive Dissonance**: Any incompatibility between two or more attitudes or between behavior and attitudes.

## Job Attitudes

- **Job Satisfaction**: A positive feeling about one’s job resulting from an evaluation of its characteristics.
- **Job Involvement**: The degree to which a person identifies with a job, actively participates in it, and considers performance important to self-worth.
- **Psychological Empowerment**: Employees’ belief in the degree to which they affect their work environment, their competence, the meaningfulness of their job, and their autonomy in their work.
- **Organizational Commitment**: The degree to which an employee identifies with a particular organization and its goals and wishes to maintain membership in the organization.
- **Perceived Organizational Support (POS)**: The degree to which employees believe an organization values their contribution and cares about their well-being.
- **Power Distance**: The degree to which people in a country accept that power in institutions and organizations is distributed unequally.
- **Employee Engagement**: An employee’s involvement with, satisfaction with, and enthusiasm for the work he or she does.

## Job Satisfaction

As important as job conditions are to job satisfaction, personality also plays an important role. People who have a positive core self-evaluation (CSE), who believe in their inner worth and basic competence, are more satisfied with their jobs than people with negative CSE's.

- **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**: An organization’s self-regulated actions to benefit society or the environment beyond what is required by law.

Pay does correlate with job satisfaction and overall happiness for many people, but the effect can be smaller once an individual reaches a standard level of comfortable living.

## Outcomes of Job Satisfaction

1. Increased job performance: happy workers are more likely to be productive workers.
2. Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB): people talking positively about their organizations, helping others, and going beyond the normal expectations of their jobs.
3. Customer Satisfaction: Satisfied employees and managers appear to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.
4. Life Satisfaction: job satisfaction is positively correlated with life satisfaction, and your attitudes and experiences in life spill over into your job approaches and experiences.

## The Impact of Job Dissatisfaction

Dissatisfaction is expressed in 4 ways:

1. **exit** Dissatisfaction expressed through behavior directed toward leaving the organization.
2. **voice** Dissatisfaction expressed through active and constructive attempts to improve conditions.
3. **loyalty** Dissatisfaction expressed by passively waiting for conditions to improve.
4. **neglect** Dissatisfaction expressed through allowing conditions to worsen.

- **Counterproductive Work Behavior (CWB)**: Actions that actively damage the organization, including stealing, behaving aggressively toward coworkers, or being late or absent.
