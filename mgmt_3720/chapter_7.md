## Motivation Defined

- **motivation**: The processes that account for an individual’s intensity, direction, and persistence of effort toward attaining a goal.

## Early Theories of Motivation

- **hierarchy of needs**: Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of five needs—physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization — in which, as each need is substantially satisfied, the next need becomes dominant.

  1. Physiological: Includes hunger, thirst, shelter, sex, and other bodily needs.
  2. Safety-security: Security and protection from physical and emotional harm.
  3. Social-belongingness: Affection, belongingness, acceptance, and friendship.
  4. Esteem: Internal factors such as self-respect, autonomy, and achievement, and external factors such as status, recognition, and attention.
  5. Self-actualization: Drive to become what we are capable of becoming; includes growth, achieving our potential, and self-fulfillment.

- **two-factor theory**: A theory that relates intrinsic factors to job satisfaction and associates extrinsic factors with dissatisfaction. Also called motivation-hygiene theory.

- **hygiene factors**: Factors, such as company policy and administration, supervision, and salary, that, when adequate in a job, placate workers. When these factors are adequate, people will not be dissatisfied.

- **McClelland’s theory of needs**: A theory that states achievement, power, and affiliation are three important needs that help explain motivation.
  - Need for achievement (nAch) is the drive to excel, to achieve in relationship to a set of standards.
  - Need for power (nPow) is the need to make others behave in a way they would not have otherwise.
  - Need for affiliation (nAff) is the desire for friendly and close interpersonal relationships.

## Contemporary Theories of Motivation

- **self-determination theory**: A theory of motivation that is concerned with the beneficial effects of intrinsic motivation and the harmful effects of extrinsic motivation.

- **cognitive evaluation theory**: A version of self-determination theory in which allocating extrinsic rewards for behavior that had been previously intrinsically rewarding tends to decrease the overall level of motivation if the rewards are seen as controlling.

- **self-concordance**: The degree to which people’s reasons for pursuing goals are consistent with their interests and core values.

- **goal-setting theory**: A theory stating that specific and difficult goals, with feedback, lead to higher performance.

- **promotion focus**: A self-regulation strategy that involves striving for goals through advancement and accomplishment.

- **prevention focus**: A self-regulation strategy that involves striving for goals by fulfilling duties and obligations.

- **management by objectives (MBO)**: A program that encompasses specific goals, participatively set, for an explicit time period, with feedback on goal progress.

## Other Contemporary Theories of Motivation

- **self-efficacy theory**: An individual’s belief that he or she is capable of performing a task.

- **reinforcement theory**: A theory suggesting that behavior is a function of its consequences.

- **behaviorism**: A theory stating that behavior follows stimuli in a relatively unthinking manner.

- **social-learning theory**: The view that we can learn through both observation and direct experience.

- **expectancy theory**: A theory stating that the strength of a tendency to act in a certain way depends on the strength of an expectation that the act will be followed by a given outcome and on the attractiveness of that outcome to the individual.

## Equity Theory/Organizational Justice

- **equity theory**: A theory stating that individuals compare their job inputs and outcomes with those of others and then respond to eliminate any inequities.

- **organizational justice**: An overall perception of what is fair in the workplace, composed of distributive, procedural, informational, and interpersonal justice.

- **distributive justice**: Perceived fairness of the amount and allocation of rewards among individuals.

- **procedural justice**: The perceived fairness of the process used to determine the distribution of rewards.

- **informational justice**: The degree to which employees are provided truthful explanations for decisions.

- **interpersonal justice**: The degree to which employees are treated with dignity and respect.

## Job Engagement

- **job engagement**: The investment of an employee’s physical, cognitive, and emotional energies into job performance.
