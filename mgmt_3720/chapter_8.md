## Motivating by Job Design: The Job Characteristics Model

- **job design**: The way the elements in a job are organized.

- **job characteristics model (JCM)**: A model proposing that any job can be described in terms of five core job dimensions: skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback.

- **skill variety**: The degree to which a job requires a variety of different activities.

- **task identity**: The degree to which a job requires completion of a whole and identifiable piece of work.

- **task significance**: The degree to which a job has a substantial impact on the lives or work of other people.

- **autonomy**: The degree to which a job provides substantial freedom and discretion to the individual in scheduling the work and in determining the procedures to be used in carrying it out.

- **feedback**: The degree to which carrying out the work activities required by a job results in the individual obtaining direct and clear information about the effectiveness of his or her performance.

- **motivating potential score (MPS)**: A predictive index that suggests the motivating potential in a job.

## Job Redesign

- **job rotation**: The periodic shifting of an employee from one task to another.

- **job enrichment**: Adding high-level responsibilities to a job to increase intrinsic motivation.

- **relational**: job design Constructing jobs so employees see the positive difference they can make in the lives of others directly through their work.

## Alternative Work Arrangements

- **flextime**: Flexible work hours.

- **job sharing**: An arrangement that allows two or more individuals to split a traditional 40-hour-a-week job.

- **telecommuting**: Working from home at least 2 days a week through virtual devices that are linked to the employer’s office.

## Employee Involvement

- **employee involvement and participation (EIP)**: A participative process that uses the input of employees to increase employee commitment to organizational success.

- **participative management**: A process in which subordinates share a significant degree of decision-making power with their immediate superiors.

- **representative participation**: A system in which workers participate in organizational decision making through a small group of representative employees.

## Using Rewards to Motivate Employees

- **variable-pay program**: A pay plan that bases a portion or all of an employee’s pay on some individual and/or organizational measure of performance.

- **piece-rate pay plan**: A pay plan in which workers are paid a fixed sum for each unit of production completed.

- **merit-based pay plan**: A pay plan based on performance appraisal ratings.

- **bonus**: A pay plan that rewards employees for recent performance rather than historical performance.

- **profit-sharing plan**: An organization-wide program that distributes compensation based on some established formula designed around a company’s profitability.

- **employee stock ownership plan (ESOP)** A company-established benefits plan in which employees acquire stock, often at below-market prices, as part of their benefits.

- **flexible benefits**: A benefits plan that allows each employee to put together a benefits package tailored to his or her own needs and situation.

## Using Intrinsic Rewards to Motivate Employees

- **employee recognition program**: A plan to encourage specific employee behaviors by formally appreciating specific employee contributions.
