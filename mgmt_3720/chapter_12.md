## Trait Theories

- **trait theories of leadership**: Theories that consider personal qualities and characteristics that differentiate leaders from non-leaders.

## Behavioral Theories

- **behavioral theories of leadership**: Theories proposing that specific behaviors differentiate leaders from non-leaders.

- **initiating structure** The extent to which a leader defines and structures his or her role and those of the subordinates to facilitate goal attainment.

- **consideration**: The extent to which a leader has job relationships that are characterized by mutual trust, respect for subordinates’ ideas, and regard for their feelings.

## Contingency Theories

- **Fiedler contingency model**: The theory that effective groups depend on a proper match between a leader’s style of interacting with subordinates and the degree to which the situation gives control and influence to the leader.

- **least preferred coworker (LPC)**: questionnaire An instrument that purports to measure whether a person is task- or relationship-oriented.

- **leader–member relations**: The degree of confidence, trust, and respect that subordinates have in their leader.

- **task structure**: The degree to which job assignments are regimented.

- **position power**: Influence derived from one’s formal structural position in the organization; includes the power to hire, fire, discipline, promote, and give salary increases.

- **situational leadership theory (SLT)**: A contingency theory that focuses on followers’ readiness to accomplish a specific task.

  - If followers are _unable_ and _unwilling_ to do a task, the leader needs to give clear and specific direction
  - if they are _unable_ but _willing_, the leader needs to display a high task orientation to compensate for followers’ lack of ability, and high relationship orientation to get them to accept the leader’s desires
  - If followers are _able_ but _unwilling_, the leader needs to use a supportive and participative style
  - if they are both _able_ and _willing_, the leader doesn’t need to do much.

- **path–goal theory**: A theory stating that it is the leader’s job to assist followers in attaining their goals and to provide the necessary direction and/or support to ensure that their goals are compatible with the overall objectives of the group or organization.

- **leader–participation model**: A leadership theory that provides a set of rules to determine the form and amount of participative decision making in different situations.

## Contemporary Theories of Leadership

- **leader–member exchange (LMX) theory**: A theory that supports leaders’ creation of ingroups and outgroups; subordinates with ingroup status have higher performance ratings, less turnover, and greater job satisfaction.

- **charismatic leadership theory** A leadership theory stating that followers make attributions of heroic or extraordinary leadership abilities when they observe certain behaviors in others

- **vision**: A long-term strategy for attaining a goal or goals.

- **vision statement**: A formal articulation of an organization’s vision or mission.

- **transactional leaders**: Leaders who guide or motivate their followers in the direction of established goals by clarifying role and task requirements.

- **transformational leaders**: Leaders who inspire, act as role models, and intellectually stimulate, develop, or mentor their followers, thus having a profound and extraordinary effect on them.

- **full range of leadership model**: A model that depicts seven management styles on a continuum: laissez-faire, management by exception, contingent reward leadership, individualized consideration, intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation, and idealized influence.

## Responsible Leadership

- **authentic leaders**: Leaders who know who they are, know what they believe in and value, and act on those values and beliefs openly and candidly.

- **socialized charismatic leadership**: A leadership concept stating that leaders convey values that are other-centered versus self-centered and who role-model ethical conduct.

- **abusive supervision**: Supervision that is hostile both verbally and nonverbally.

- **servant leadership**: A leadership style marked by going beyond the leader’s own self-interest and instead focusing on opportunities to help followers grow and develop.

## Positive Leadership

- **trust**: A positive expectation that another will not act opportunistically.

The Outcomes of Trust Trust between supervisors and employees has many specific advantages. Here are just a few from research:

- _Trust encourages taking risks_: Whenever leaders and employees decide to deviate from the usual way of doing things, or when employees decide to take their supervisor’s word on a new direction, they are taking a risk. In both cases, a trusting relationship can facilitate that leap.125
- _Trust facilitates information sharing_: One big reason employees fail to express concerns at work is that they don’t feel psychologically safe revealing their views. When managers demonstrate that they will give employees’ ideas a fair hearing and actively make changes, employees are more willing to speak out.126
- _Trusting groups are more effective_: When a leader sets a trusting tone in a group, members are more willing to help each other and exert extra effort, which increases trust. Members of mistrusting groups tend to be suspicious of each other, constantly guard against exploitation, and restrict communication with others in the group. These actions tend to undermine and eventually destroy the group.127
- _Trust enhances productivity_: The bottom-line interest of companies appears to be positively influenced by trust. Employees who trust their supervisors tend to receive higher performance ratings, indicating higher productivity. People respond to mistrust by concealing information and secretly pursuing their own interests.

- **trust propensity** How likely an employee is to trust a leader.

- **mentor**: A senior employee who sponsors and supports a less-experienced employee, called a protégé.

## Challenges to Our Understanding of Leadership

- **attribution theory of leadership**: A leadership theory stating that leadership is merely an attribution that people make about other individuals.

- **substitutes**: Attributes, such as experience and training, that can replace the need for a leader’s support or ability to create structure.

- **neutralizers**: Attributes that make it impossible for leader behavior to make any difference to follower outcomes.
