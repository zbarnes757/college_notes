## Personality

- **Personality**: The sum of ways in which an individual reacts to and interacts with others.

- **Personality Traits**: Enduring characteristics that describe an individual’s behavior.

## Personality Frameworks

The most widely used and best known personality frameworks are the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the Big Five Personality Model.

### Myers-Briggs Type Indicator

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is one of the most widely used personality assessment instruments in the world.14 It is a 100-question personality test that asks people how they usually feel or act in situations. Respondents are classified as extroverted or introverted (E or I), sensing or intuitive (S or N), thinking or feeling (T or F), and judging or perceiving (J or P):

- Extroverted (E) versus Introverted (I). Extroverted individuals are outgoing, sociable, and assertive. Introverts are quiet and shy.
- Sensing (S) versus Intuitive (N). Sensing types are practical and prefer routine and order, and they focus on details. Intuitives rely on unconscious processes and look at the big picture.
- Thinking (T) versus Feeling (F). Thinking types use reason and logic to handle problems. Feeling types rely on their personal values and emotions.
- Judging (J) versus Perceiving (P). Judging types want control and prefer order and structure. Perceiving types are flexible and spontaneous.

### Big Five Model

1. **Conscientiousness**: The conscientiousness dimension is a measure of personal consistency and reliability. A highly conscientious person is responsible, organized, dependable, and persistent. Those who score low on this dimension are easily distracted, disorganized, and unreliable.
2. **Emotional stability**: The emotional stability dimension taps a person’s ability to withstand stress. People with emotional stability tend to be calm, self-confident, and secure. High scorers are more likely to be positive and optimistic and to experience fewer negative emotions; they are generally happier than low scorers. Emotional stability is sometimes discussed as its converse, neuroticism. Low scorers (those with high neuroticism) are hypervigilant and vulnerable to the physical and psychological effects of stress. Those with high neuroticism tend to be nervous, anxious, depressed, and insecure.
3. **Extraversion**: The extraversion dimension captures our relational approach toward the social world. Extraverts tend to be gregarious, assertive, and sociable. They experience more positive emotions than do introverts, and they more freely express these feelings. On the other hand, introverts (low extraversion) tend to be more thoughtful, reserved, timid, and quiet.
4. **Openness to experience**: The openness to experience dimension addresses the range of interests and fascination with novelty. Open people are creative, curious, and artistically sensitive. Those at the low end of the category are conventional and find comfort in the familiar.
5. **Agreeableness**: The agreeableness dimension refers to an individual’s propensity to defer to others. Agreeable people are cooperative, warm, and trusting. You might expect agreeable people to be happier than disagreeable people. They are, but only slightly. When people choose organizational team members, agreeable individuals are usually their first choice. In contrast, people who score low on agreeableness are cold and antagonistic.

## Other Personality Attributes Relevant to OB

- **core self-evaluation (CSE)**: Bottom-line conclusions individuals have about their capabilities, competence, and worth as a person.

- **self-monitoring**: A personality trait that measures an individual’s ability to adjust his or her behavior to external, situational factors.

- **proactive personality**: People who identify opportunities, show initiative, take action, and persevere until meaningful change occurs.

## Personality, Job Search, and Unemployment

A relevant question involves the behaviors of those who are unemployed and looking for a job: What personality characteristics predict job search behaviors (e.g., networking intensity) among the unemployed? Many studies of unemployed job seekers have found that conscientiousness and extraversion were predictive of networking intensity, general job search intensity, interview callbacks, and job offers, even after controlling for demographic characteristics and the time spent unemployed.

## Personality and Situations

- **situation strength theory**: A theory indicating that the way personality translates into behavior depends on the strength of the situation.

- **trait activation theory (TAT)**: A theory that predicts that some situations, events, or interventions "activate" a trait more than others.

## Values

- **values**: Basic convictions that a specific mode of conduct or end-state of existence is personally or socially preferable to an opposite or converse mode of conduct or end-state of existence.

- **value system**: A hierarchy based on a ranking of an individual’s values in terms of their intensity.
