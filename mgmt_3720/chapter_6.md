6. Contrast the three ethical decision criteria.
7. Describe the three-stage model of creativity.

## What Is Perception?

Perception is a process by which we organize and interpret sensory impressions to give meaning to our environment. The world as it is perceived is the world that is behaviorally important. In other words, our perception becomes the reality from which we act.

## Person Perception: Making Judgments About Others

- **attribution theory**: An attempt to explain the ways we judge people differently, depending on the meaning we attribute to a behavior, such as determining whether an individual’s behavior is internally or externally caused.

Attribution theory suggests that when we observe an individual’s behavior, we attempt to determine whether it was internally or externally caused. That determination depends largely on three factors:

1. distinctiveness
2. consensus
3. consistency

- **fundamental attribution error**: The tendency to underestimate the influence of external factors and overestimate the influence of internal factors when making judgments about the behavior of others.

- **self-serving bias**: The tendency for individuals to attribute their own successes to internal factors and put the blame for failures on external factors.

- **selective perception**: The tendency to choose to interpret what one sees based on one’s interests, background, experience, and attitudes.

- **halo effect**: The tendency to draw a positive general impression about an individual based on a single characteristic.

- **horns effect**: The tendency to draw a negative general impression about an individual based on a single characteristic.

- **contrast effect**: Evaluation of a person’s characteristics that is affected by comparisons with other people recently encountered who rank higher or lower on the same characteristics.

- **stereotyping**: Judging someone based on one’s perception of the group to which that person belongs.

- **self-fulfilling prophecy**: A situation in which a person inaccurately perceives a second person and the resulting expectations cause the second person to behave in ways consistent with the original perception.

## The Link Between Perception and Individual Decision Making

- **decisions**: Choices made from among two or more alternatives.

- **problem**: A discrepancy between the current state of affairs and some desired state.

## Decision Making in Organizations

- **rational**: Characterized by making consistent, value-maximizing choices within specified constraints.

- **rational decision-making model**: A decision-making model that describes how individuals should behave to maximize some outcome.

Steps in the rational decision making model

1. Define the problem.
2. Identify the decision criteria.
3. Allocate weights to the criteria.
4. Develop the alternatives.
5. Evaluate the alternatives.
6. Select the best alternative.

- **bounded rationality**: A process of making decisions by constructing simplified models that extract the essential features from problems without capturing all their complexity.

- **intuitive decision**: making An unconscious process created out of distilled experience.

- **anchoring bias**: A tendency to fixate on initial information, from which one then fails to adjust adequately for subsequent information.

- **confirmation bias**: The tendency to seek out information that reaffirms past choices and to discount information that contradicts past judgments.

- **availability bias**: The tendency for people to base their judgments on information that is readily available to them.

- **escalation of commitment**: An increased commitment to a previous decision despite negative information.

- **randomness error**: The tendency of individuals to believe that they can predict the outcome of random events.

- **risk aversion**: The tendency to prefer a sure gain of a moderate amount over a riskier outcome, even if the riskier outcome might have a higher expected payoff.

- **hindsight bias**: The tendency to believe falsely, after an outcome of an event is actually known, that one would have accurately predicted that outcome.

## What About Ethics in Decision Making?

- **utilitarianism**: An ethical perspective in which decisions are made to provide the greatest good for all.

- **whistle-blowers**: Individuals who report unethical practices by their employer to outsiders.

- **deonance**: A perspective in which ethical decisions are made because you “ought to” in order to be consistent with moral norms, principles, standards, rules, or laws.

- **behavioral ethics**: Analyzing how people behave when confronted with ethical dilemmas.

## Creativity, Creative Decision Making, and Innovation in Organizations

- **creativity**: The ability to produce novel and useful ideas.

Creative Behavior Steps:

1. **Problem formulation**: The stage of creative behavior that involves identifying a problem or opportunity requiring a solution that is yet unknown.

2. **Information Gathering**: The stage of creative behavior when possible solutions to a problem incubate in an individual’s mind.

3. **Idea Generation**: The process of creative behavior that involves developing possible solutions to a problem from relevant information and knowledge.

4. **Idea Evaluation**: The process of creative behavior involving the evaluation of potential solutions to problems to identify the best one.
