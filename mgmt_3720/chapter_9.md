## Learning Objectives

1. Distinguish between the different types of groups.
2. Describe the punctuated-equilibrium model of group development.
3. Show how role requirements change in different situations.
4. Demonstrate how norms exert influence on an individual’s behavior.
5. Show how status and size differences affect group performance.
6. Describe how issues of cohesiveness and diversity can be integrated for group effectiveness.
7. Contrast the strengths and weaknesses of group decision making.

## Defining and Classifying Groups

- **group**: Two or more individuals, interacting and interdependent, who have come together to achieve particular objectives.

- **formal group**: A designated work group defined by an organization’s structure.

- **informal group**: A group that is neither formally structured nor organizationally determined; such a group appears in response to the need for social contact.

- **social identity theory**: Perspective that considers when and why individuals consider themselves members of groups.

- **ingroup favoritism**: Perspective in which we see members of our ingroup as better than other people, and people not in our group as all the same.

- **outgroup**: The inverse of an ingroup, which can mean everyone outside the group but is more usually an identified other group.

## Stages of Group Development

- **punctuated-equilibrium model**: A set of phases that temporary groups go through that involves transitions between inertia and activity.

The stages are:

1. The first meeting sets the group’s direction,
2. the first phase of group activity is one of inertia and thus slower progress,
3. a transition takes place exactly when the group has used up half its allotted time,
4. this transition initiates major changes,
5. a second phase of inertia follows the transition, and
6. the group’s last meeting is characterized by markedly accelerated activity.

## Group Property 1: Roles

- **role**: A set of expected behavior patterns attributed to someone occupying a given position in a social unit.

- **role perception**: An individual’s view of how he or she is supposed to act in a given situation.

- **role expectations**: How others believe a person should act in a given situation.

- **psychological contract**: An unwritten agreement that sets out what a manager expects from an employee, and vice versa.

- **role conflict**: A situation in which an individual is confronted by divergent role expectations.

- **interrole conflict**: A situation in which the expectations of an individual’s different, separate groups are in opposition.

## Group Property 2: Norms

- **norms**: Acceptable standards of behavior within a group that are shared by the group’s members.

- **conformity**: The adjustment of one’s behavior to align with the norms of the group.

- **reference groups**: Important groups to which individuals belong or hope to belong and with whose norms individuals are likely to conform.

- **deviant workplace behavior**: Voluntary behavior that violates significant organizational norms and, in so doing, threatens the well-being of the organization or its members. Also called antisocial behavior or workplace incivility.

## Group Property 3: Status, and Group Property 4: Size and Dynamics

- **status**: A socially defined position or rank given to groups or group members by others.

- **status characteristics theory**: A theory stating that differences in status characteristics create status hierarchies within groups.

According to status characteristics theory, status tends to derive from one of three sources:

1. The power a person wields over others. Because they likely control the group’s resources, people who control group outcomes tend to be perceived as high status.
2. A person’s ability to contribute to a group’s goals. People whose contributions are critical to the group’s success tend to have high status.
3. An individual’s personal characteristics. Someone whose personal characteristics are positively valued by the group (good looks, intelligence, money, or a friendly personality) typically has higher status than someone with fewer valued attributes.

- **social loafing**: The tendency for individuals to expend less effort when working collectively than when working individually.

## Group Property 5: Cohesiveness, and Group Property 6: Diversity

- **cohesiveness**: The degree to which group members are attracted to each other and are motivated to stay in the group.

- **diversity**: The extent to which members of a group are similar to, or different from, one another.

- **faultlines**: The perceived divisions that split groups into two or more subgroups based on individual differences such as sex, race, age, work experience, and education.

## Group Decision Making

Strengths:

1. _generate more complete information and knowledge_: By aggregating the resources of several individuals, groups bring more input as well as heterogeneity into the decision process.
2. _They offer increased diversity of views_: This opens up the opportunity to consider more approaches and alternatives.
3. _groups lead to increased acceptance of a solution_: Group members who participate in making a decision are more likely to support it enthusiastically and to encourage others to accept it later.

Weaknesses:

1. _There are conformity pressures_: The desire by group members to be accepted and considered an asset to the group can squash any overt disagreement.
2. _Group discussion can be dominated by one or a few members_: If they’re low- and medium-ability members, the group’s overall effectiveness will suffer.
3. _group decisions suffer from ambiguous responsibility_: In an individual decision, it’s clear who is accountable for the final outcome. In a group decision, the responsibility of any single member is diluted.

- **groupthink**: A phenomenon in which the norm for consensus overrides the realistic appraisal of alternative courses of action.

- **groupshift**: A change between a group’s decision and an individual decision that a member within the group would make; the shift can be toward either conservatism or greater risk but it generally is toward a more extreme version of the group’s original position.

Types of groups:

- **interacting groups**: Typical groups in which members interact with each other face-to-face.

- **brainstorming**: An idea-generation process that specifically encourages any and all alternatives while withholding any criticism of those alternatives.

- **nominal group technique**: A group decision making method in which individual members meet face-to-face to pool their judgments in a systematic but independent fashion.
