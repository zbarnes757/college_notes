## Diversity

- **Surface-level Diversity**: Differences in easily perceived characteristics, such as gender, race, ethnicity, age, or disability, that do not necessarily reflect the ways people think or feel but that may activate certain stereotypes.

- **Deep-level Diversity**: Differences in values, personality, and work preferences that become progressively more important for determining similarity as people get to know one another better.

## Discrimination

- **Discrimination**: Noting of a difference between things; often we refer to unfair discrimination, which means making judgments about individuals based on stereotypes regarding their demographic group.

- **Stereotyping**: Judging someone on the basis of our perception of the group to which that person belongs.

- **Stereotype Threat**: The degree to which we agree internally with the generally negative stereotyped perceptions of our groups.
