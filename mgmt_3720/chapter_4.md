## What Are Emotions and Moods?

- **Affect**: A broad range of feelings that people experience.
- **Emotions**: Intense, discrete, and short-lived feeling experiences that are often caused by a specific event.
- **Moods**: Feelings that tend to be longer-lived and less intense than emotions and that lack a contextual stimulus.

Our experiences of emotions are closely tied to our interpretations of events.

- **Moral Emotions**: Emotions that have moral implications because of our instant judgment of the situation that evokes them.

## Emotional Labor

- **Emotional Labor**: A situation in which an employee expresses organizationally desired emotions during interpersonal transactions at work.

Felt emotions are what is going on inside vs Displayed emotions which are what are shown to others.

## Affective Events Theory

- **Affective Events Theory (AET)**: A model suggesting that workplace events cause emotional reactions on the part of employees, which then influence workplace attitudes and behaviors.

In sum, AET offers two important messages.

1. Emotions provide valuable insights into how workplace events influence employee performance and satisfaction.
2. Employees and managers shouldn’t ignore emotions or the events that cause them, even when they appear minor, because they accumulate.

## Emotional Intelligence

Emotional intelligence (EI) is a person’s ability to:

1. Perceive emotions in the self and others
2. Understand the meaning of these emotions
3. Regulate his or her own emotions accordingly

People who know their own emotions and are good at reading emotional cues, for instance, knowing why they’re angry and how to express themselves without violating norms, are most likely to be effective.

## Emotion Regulation

The central idea behind emotion regulation is to identify and modify the emotions you feel. Emotion regulation can come from within the individual due to their own personality or it can come as a result of the persons surroundings.
