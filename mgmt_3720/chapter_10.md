## Why Have Teams Become So Popular?

Why are teams popular? In short, because we believe they are effective. “A team of people happily committed to the project and to one another will outperform a brilliant individual every time,” writes Forbes publisher Rich Karlgaard.

## Differences Between Groups and Teams

- **work group**: A group that interacts primarily to share information, make decisions, and help each group member perform within his or her area of responsibility.

- **work team**: A group whose individual efforts result in performance that is greater than the sum of the individual inputs.

## Types of Teams

1. **problem-solving teams**: Groups of 5 to 12 employees from the same department who meet for a few hours each week to discuss ways of improving quality, efficiency, and the work environment.
2. **self-managed work teams**: Groups of 10 to 15 employees who take on responsibilities of their former supervisors.
3. **cross-functional teams**: Employees from about the same hierarchical level but from different work areas who come together to accomplish a task.
4. **virtual teams**: Teams that use computer technology to tie together physically dispersed members in order to achieve a common goal.
5. **multiteam system**: A collection of two or more interdependent teams that share a superordinate goal; a team of teams.

## Creating Effective Teams

The four contextual factors most significantly related to team performance:

1. adequate resources
2. effective leadership
3. a climate of trust
4. a performance evaluation and reward system

- **organizational demography**: The degree to which members of a work unit share a common demographic attribute, such as age, sex, race, educational level, or length of service in an organization, and the impact of this attribute on turnover.

- **reflexivity**: A team characteristic of reflecting on and adjusting the master plan when necessary.

- **team efficacy**: A team’s collective belief that they can succeed at their tasks.

- **team identity**: A team member’s affinity for and sense of belongingness to his or her team.

- **team cohesion**: A situation when team members are emotionally attached to one another and motivated toward the team because of their attachment.

- **mental model**: Team members’ knowledge and beliefs about how the work gets done by the team.

## Turning Individuals into Team Players

- hire team players
- create team players with training
- provide incentives to be a team player

## Beware! Teams Aren’t Always the Answer

Teamwork takes more time and often more resources than individual work. Teams have increased communication demands, conflicts to manage, and meetings to run. So the benefits of using teams have to exceed the costs, and that’s not always possible.
